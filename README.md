# COVALENTüîÆ GAS‚õΩÔ∏è PRICE DASHBOARDüìä

## Details

This single-page application (SPA) was developed as part of the Covalent bounty initiative titled "Build and Deploy a Chain-specific Gas Price Dashboard Using GoldRush Kit." The application allows users to input their Covalent API key, select a blockchain, and choose from various event types. The platform dynamically presents gas prices related to the selected event type for the chosen blockchain, enhancing user experience and providing valuable insights into gas prices for specific blockchain activities.

## Deliverables
- Front-end code of the SPA using existing GoldRush components and ones you build.
- Deployment of the application on a hosting platform like Vercel.
- User input sections for the Covalent API key, chain selection, and event type.
- A display area showing real-time 1, 3, and 5-minute average gas prices related to the selected chain and event type.
- Use https://ui.shadcn.com/ and https://www.tremor.so/ to render data, similar to how GoldRush Kit does now.
- Documentation detailing the use of the page and steps to obtain an API key.
- A statement or best practice guide on the secure usage and non-retention of the user's API key.
